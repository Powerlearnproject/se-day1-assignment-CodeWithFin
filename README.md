Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

-Software Engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles,methods and tools to the development and maintenance of high-quality software systems. 
-It is important in a way that it enables creation of software applications and systems that power various aspect of modern life such as communication.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

-Development of programming Languages such as Fortran
-Establishment of Software Engineering as a discipline in the 1960s
-The Rise of Agile methodologies in the 2000s

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

1.Requirements - gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
2.Design - Creating high- level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface 
3.Implementation - writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.
4.Testing - conducting tests to ensure software is of quality and meets functional requirements.
5.Deployment - Releasing the software to users or customers.
6.Maintenance - Providing ongoing support,updates and enhancements to the software after deployment.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

-Waterfall methodology is a sequential approach with distinct phases flowing downwards like a waterfall while Agile methodology is an iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility,collaboration and responding to changes.
-Waterfall methodology is best for projects that have a well defined scope and have minimal to zero changes while Agile methodology is best for projects where flexibility and customer feedbacks are important.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

1.Software Developer - Responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions.
2.Quality Assurance Engineer - Ensures Software Quality by designing and executing test plans.
3.Project Manager- Oversees the planning, execution and delivery of software systems.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

1.IDEs - provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging and testing code such as Visual Studio.
2.VCS -Enable Software Engineers to track changes to source code and coordinate woke among team members.eg .Git

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

1.Changing Requirements - effective communications.
2.Tight Deadlines - regular reassessment of project goals and timelines.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

1.Unit Testing - Testing individual Components or modules of software.
2.Integration Testing - Testing integrations between different components or subsystems.
3.System Testing - Testing the entire software system as a whole.
4.Acceptance Testing -Testing the software against user requirements to ensure to meets user needs.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Prompt Engineering - is all about crafting questions or statements to get the best possible responses from AI models.
It helps us to avoid getting confusing answers from AI models.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
 
"Tell me about Cats"
"Tell me about the history of Domestic Cats" 
- you will get a more accurate answer on domestic cats rather than cats in general.
